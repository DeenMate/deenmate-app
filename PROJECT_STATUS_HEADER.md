Sprint / Focus: Critical Module Development & API Integration

---

## Executive Summary

DeenMate is 78% complete (171/220 story points) with strong foundational modules demonstrating exemplary implementation patterns. Two critical modules (Zakat P0, Inheritance P1) require complete rebuilds despite being documented as complete. Active development on Hadith API integration shows strong progress with production-ready architecture.

**Immediate Priority**: Complete Hadith API integration while planning Zakat module rebuild (P0 critical business feature).
